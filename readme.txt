This application aim at providing knowledge about how an basic file transfer occrs. 

In the realm of digital communication, file transfer is a fundamental operation. Whether you're sharing documents, images, or any other data, ensuring the security and integrity of the transferred files is paramount. This is where protocols like FTP (File Transfer Protocol), encryption techniques like Fernet algorithm, and cryptographic hashing methods like SHA-256 come into play.

FTP, the granddaddy of file transfer protocols, has been around since the early days of the internet. It facilitates the transfer of files between a client and a server over a network. However, traditional FTP lacks built-in security mechanisms, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and unauthorized access.

To address these security concerns, encryption algorithms like Fernet are employed. Fernet is a symmetric encryption algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. It ensures that the transferred files are encrypted before leaving the sender's system and can only be decrypted by the intended recipient with the appropriate key.

But encryption alone is not enough. Ensuring the integrity of the transferred files is equally crucial. This is where cryptographic hashing algorithms like SHA-256 come into play. SHA-256 generates a unique fixed-size hash value for a given input, making it practically impossible for two different inputs to produce the same hash value. By calculating the hash value of a file before and after transfer, any alteration or tampering with the file can be detected, ensuring its integrity.

Combining these elements, the file transfer process becomes robust and secure. Here's how it works:

1. Encryption: Before initiating the file transfer, the sender encrypts the files using the Fernet algorithm. This ensures that even if intercepted, the files remain unintelligible to unauthorized entities.

2. Transmission: The encrypted files are then transmitted over the network using the FTP protocol. While in transit, they are shielded from potential threats by the encryption layer.

3. Decryption: Upon reaching the recipient's system, the encrypted files are decrypted using the corresponding decryption key. This step ensures that the recipient can access the original content of the files.

4. Integrity Check: Before and after the transfer, the SHA-256 hash value of each file is calculated. By comparing these hash values, any unauthorized modification or corruption of the files can be detected.

By integrating FTP for efficient file transfer, Fernet algorithm for encryption, and SHA-256 for integrity verification, organizations can establish a secure and reliable file transfer mechanism. This ensures that sensitive data remains protected during transit, safeguarding confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.
